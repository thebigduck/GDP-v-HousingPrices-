## Project Description
The Struggle for Homeownership: Economic Indicators and Their Personal Impact in an Era of Inflation

Introduction This investigation casts a spotlight on the personal struggles tied to economic indicators and their direct impact on the US housing market. It probes the stark reality that, as economic figures rise, the dream of homeownership dims for many, given the widening gap between housing prices and average incomes.

Historical Context

1980s Stagflation: A time when economic hardship and high inflation eroded personal savings, challenging the notion of home as an attainable asset.
2008 Housing Market Crash: A devastating blow to individual wealth, with a long-lasting effect on the ability to invest in real estate.
2017 Economic Fluctuations: A period of deceptive economic growth, potentially leaving individuals vulnerable to market forces and policy decisions.
Data Compilation The study examines data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, with a focus on:

Median New House Prices ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS)): A reflection of the increasing difficulty for individuals to afford homes.
GDP  ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA)): Benchmark for our economic prospertiy as a country.
Real GDP per Capita ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RC0Q052SBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA)): A metric that accounts for inflation, which reveals the true economic standing of individuals.
Methodological Framework

Data Contextualization: Adjusting historical data for inflation to align with the real-world experience of individuals.
Exploratory Inquiry: Analyzing the disconnect between GDP, Real GDP, and the practicality of homeownership, mindful of the individual’s plight.
Key Findings

Economic Hardships: The analysis uncovers the harsh truth that economic growth does not equate to increased wealth or homeownership opportunities for many.
Housing Market Exclusivity: The escalating cost of homes is outpacing income growth, pushing the prospect of homeownership out of reach for the average person.
Inflationary Erosion: The disparity between nominal and Real GDP growth rates highlights how inflation undermines the individual’s financial stability and purchasing power.
Projections and Consequences

Homeownership Challenges: The study forecasts a continuing decline in homeownership rates, as economic pressures and inflated housing costs persist.
Investment Impediments: For most, the largest investment of their lives—buying a home—is becoming increasingly unattainable.
Final Reflections Our examination of economic indicators, in relation to housing prices and personal financial health, underscores the urgent need for policies that bridge the gap between economic growth and the real benefits felt by individuals, particularly in the context of homeownership.
